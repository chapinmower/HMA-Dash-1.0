## Extraction Guidelines

1. **Accuracy is Critical**: Double-check all extracted numbers against the source PDFs
2. **Handle Missing Data**: If a metric is not available, use null instead of 0
3. **Percentage Format**: Convert percentages to decimal format (e.g., 58.5% → 0.585)
4. **Date Format**: Use ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD) for all dates
5. **Preserve Original Values**: Don't round or modify the original data values
